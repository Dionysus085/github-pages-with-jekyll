Is what you know really true? Were the dinosores really wiped out by an asteroid - Or was it the space ship carrying the aliens that we eventually evolved from landing??
I don't know what I believe when it comes to this - but isn't a magnetic field generated by a massive ammount of energy being pumped through a metal? 
Maybe something along the lines of - The fusion reactor from our mother ship connected to the earths core releasing a huge ammount of energy into the earths core to keep us generate a magnetic field arround the earth??
Why you may ask?
- To shield us from the intergalactic community that we have somehow wronged in the past?
- To ward off other aliens? 
- all I know is that we may never know the answer to any of these questions in truth, only what the governemtnt has decreed is safe for the public to know as the truth is what is taught in schools!!
Wake up sheeple (sheep people)
